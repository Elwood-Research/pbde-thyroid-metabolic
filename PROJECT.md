# Project: PBDEs, Thyroid Hormones, and Metabolic Health

## Research Question
Are serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other flame retardants associated with thyroid hormone levels and subsequent effects on lipid metabolism and insulin resistance?

## Objectives
1. **Thyroid Association**: Evaluate the association between serum PBDE levels (congeners 47, 99, 153, and 209) and thyroid hormone levels (TSH, Free T4, and Free T3).
2. **Lipid Profile**: Assess the association between serum PBDE levels and lipid parameters, including Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and Triglycerides.
3. **Insulin Resistance**: Examine the relationship between serum PBDE levels and insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR.
4. **Mediation Analysis**: Investigate whether thyroid hormone disruption mediates the relationship between PBDE exposure and metabolic outcomes (lipids and insulin resistance).
