# Hypotheses

## Primary Hypotheses
1. **Hypothesis 1 (Thyroid Disruption)**: Higher serum concentrations of PBDE congeners (especially PBDE 47 and 99) are associated with decreased Free T4 levels and increased TSH levels, consistent with a pattern of primary hypothyroidism or thyroid hormone transport interference.
2. **Hypothesis 2 (Lipid Dysregulation)**: Higher serum PBDE levels are positively associated with Total Cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and Triglycerides, and negatively associated with HDL-cholesterol.
3. **Hypothesis 3 (Metabolic Impairment)**: Higher serum PBDE levels are positively associated with insulin resistance, as indicated by higher HOMA-IR values.

## Secondary Hypothesis
4. **Hypothesis 4 (Mediation)**: The association between PBDE exposure and metabolic outcomes (lipids and HOMA-IR) is partially mediated by alterations in thyroid hormone levels (Free T4 and TSH).
