## Verification Notes
- All DOIs resolve to the cited work.
- Study populations primarily include NHANES participants, with supplementary evidence from longitudinal cohorts (CHAMACOS, Alaska Native study) to provide broader context for thyroid-metabolic disruption.
- Mechanistic papers (Costa & Giordano) provide biological plausibility for endocrine disruption.
