# Discussion and Conclusion

## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings
This study investigated the associations between serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and markers of thyroid function, lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Our analysis revealed significant associations that support the hypothesis that PBDEs act as multi-system endocrine disruptors.

Specifically, we found that higher serum concentrations of BDE-100 and BDE-154 were significantly associated with lower levels of Free Thyroxine (FT4). These findings suggest a thyroid-disrupting effect, potentially shifting individuals toward a subclinical hypothyroid state. Furthermore, nearly all measured PBDE congeners (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, and BDE-154) exhibited positive associations with serum triglycerides. BDE-154 was also strongly associated with elevated total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. Regarding glucose metabolism, BDE-47 and BDE-99 were positively associated with HOMA-IR, a standard marker of insulin resistance.

### Comparison with Existing Literature
Our results are consistent with previous research identifying PBDEs as potent thyroid disruptors. The structural similarity between PBDEs and T4 allows these compounds to interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis, transport, and peripheral metabolism. Previous NHANES-based studies have reported similar inverse associations between PBDEs and T4 levels, although results often vary by congener and demographic group (Chen et al., 2013; Makey et al., 2016).

The observed associations with metabolic outcomes align with broader literature on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The link between PBDEs and insulin resistance mirrors earlier findings by Lim et al. (2008), who reported a positive correlation between PBDE exposure and diabetes prevalence in the NHANES 2003–2004 cohort. Our study extends this by demonstrating these associations in more recent cycles and highlighting the concurrent disruption of thyroid and lipid profiles.

### Potential Biological Mechanisms
Several mechanisms may explain these associations. PBDEs can compete with T4 for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a major thyroid hormone transport protein, which may increase the clearance of T4 from the blood. Thyroid hormones are critical regulators of lipid metabolism; they enhance the expression of LDL receptors and stimulate lipoprotein lipase activity. Consequently, the PBDE-induced reduction in FT4 levels could lead to decreased lipid clearance, manifesting as the elevated triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol observed in our study.

Furthermore, PBDEs may promote insulin resistance through direct effects on adipose tissue. Exposure to brominated flame retardants has been linked to oxidative stress and the activation of inflammatory pathways in adipocytes, which can impair insulin signaling independently of or in tandem with thyroid disruption.

### Strengths and Limitations
A major strength of this study is the use of a large, nationally representative sample from NHANES, which enhances the generalizability of the findings to the U.S. adult population. The use of weighted analysis for pooled samples ensures that the results account for the complex survey design. We also adjusted for key confounders, including age, gender, BMI, and cotinine levels.

However, several limitations must be noted. First, the cross-sectional design of NHANES precludes any definitive conclusions regarding causality. While we hypothesize that PBDEs lead to thyroid and metabolic disruption, prospective longitudinal studies are required to confirm the temporal nature of these relationships. Second, the use of pooled samples for PBDE measurements, while efficient for population-level monitoring, may mask individual-level variability in exposure and response. Finally, although we adjusted for BMI and cotinine, there may be residual confounding from other environmental exposures or dietary factors that were not included in the models.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that serum levels of PBDEs are associated with lower free thyroid hormone levels and unfavorable metabolic profiles, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, in a representative sample of the U.S. population. These findings suggest that environmental exposure to brominated flame retardants may contribute to the burden of metabolic and endocrine disorders. Despite the phase-out of many PBDEs, their persistence in the environment and human body remains a public health concern. Future research should focus on the long-term metabolic consequences of PBDE exposure and the potential for regulatory interventions to mitigate these risks.
